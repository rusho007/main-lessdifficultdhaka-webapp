# main-lessdifficultdhaka-webapp

A web app to promote rain water harvesting in Bangladesh.

HTML, CSS, JS, QGIS, jQuery, are used here.

NASA WorldWind Engine is used for 3D model.

What is Less Difficult Dhaka?

Less Difficult Dhaka is a Web App which is intended to solve three major water related issues in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Road water-logging, clean water crisis and mosquito epidemic has made the city life challenging.

The purpose of the application to make people aware of the solution of such problems by implementing rain water harvesting technology on rooftops. It has tools which take you directly to your home on a map and show the calculated data for your specific structure. The data includes the water volume you can harvest, the energy you can save and as a result no waterlogging.

The application is uses satellite imagery which is prepared by QGIS software. The results are exported in web site using HTML5, Javascript, jQuery and CSS. Our 3D globe tool to mark water logging on a map uses NASA WorldWind technology. Our data set consists of more than one million geo-data of various attributes of the Dhaka city.

What is Rain Water Harvesting


Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater can be collected from rivers or roofs, and in many places, the water collected is redirected to a deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), a reservoir with percolation, or collected from dew or fog with nets or other tools. Its uses include water for gardens, livestock, irrigation, domestic use with proper treatment, indoor heating for houses, etc. The harvested water can also be used as drinking water, longer-term storage, and for other purposes such as groundwater recharge.


UN World Challenge 2018
This project has been developed as a submission for the challange. It was inspired by a research word we conducted at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) on rain water harvesing feasibility in Bangladesh.
